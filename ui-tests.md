# UI Tests üì±

This chapter of the cookbook can be considered as `exploration stage` for the following reasons:

- First is that the author does not have a lot of experience with UI tests, 
- Second, this chapter only talks about the UI test tools that comes bundled with Xcode, and not some of the other options like [iOS Snapshot Test Case](https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case), [EarlGrey](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey) and [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF),
- And the last is that the chapter ends with an opinionated paragraph, and might not show the opinion of the whole team.

### Introduction

Xcode 7 introduced UI testing, which lets us to create a UI test by recording interactions with the UI. UI testing works by finding an app‚Äôs UI objects with queries, synthesizing events, then sending them to those objects. The API enables us to examine a UI object‚Äôs properties and state in order to compare them against the expected state.

UI tests tools that we get with Xcode rests upon two core technologies: the XCTest framework and Accessibility.

- __XCTest__ provides the framework for UI testings, expanding on the same tools you already know from your Unit tests, like XCTAssert and all its relatives!

- __Accessibility__. Yes, you might be asking yourself "why this guy started talking about Accessibility" right now, but it is not only related, but crucial to have UI tests! We use Accessibility tools that are normally are used for providing disabled users a good experience on iOS to also detect what is exposed for external use (the views that on the screen, interactable or not) and use that information for testing.

Main reason we need to use Accessibility to extract information about the UI state of the app is that UI testing is a [black-box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing) framework. We shouldn't have to know anything about the implementation of the code we are testing. We can think of UI testing from the perspective of the user. The user doesn't care how our `MassiveViewController` works (or even that it exists üòà), so why should the UI Tests?

### Getting Started

If your project doesn't already have a target for UI tests, you can add one by going to `File > New > Target..` in Xcode and select a ‚ÄúUI testing bundle‚Äù. Then edit your app‚Äôs scheme to run your UI tests when testing, by going to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme..` in Xcode and adding your UI testing bundle under ‚ÄúTest‚Äù.

Before we start with and example, let's talk about using Accessibility to identify views in UI tests. To give our UI elements accesibility identifiers, we can either use interface builder or do it in the implementation code.
  - To use interface builder to give an identifier we need to select the view, go to `Identity inspector` tab and set a value for `Identifier` field located in the `Accessibility` section.
  - To give the identifier in code, set `accessibilityIdentifier` of the view to the identifier string you want like following: `anyView.accessibilityIdentifier = "someIdentifierString"`



You can see the the gif below to see the flow we will be testing. Here we will test closing the view by tapping close button, closing the view by swiping down and entering credentials and tapping `Let's Go!` button to signup.

Now let's start with the example:

*(The comments that start with `*` will be the explanations for the chapter, and others are just regular comments.)*

```

import XCTest

extension XCUIApplication {
    func openSignupScreen() {
        buttons["Sign Up"].tap()
    }
}

extension XCUIElement {
    /**
     Removes any current text in the field before typing in the new value
     - Parameter text: the text to enter into the field
     */
    func clearAndEnterText(text: String) {
        guard let stringValue = self.value as? String else {
            XCTFail("Tried to clear and enter text into a non string value")
            return
        }

        self.tap()

        let deleteString = stringValue.map { _ in XCUIKeyboardKey.delete.rawValue }.joined(separator: "")

        self.typeText(deleteString)
        self.typeText(text)
    }
}

class SignupUITests: XCTestCase {

    var app: XCUIApplication!

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()

        // * We set this property to false to end test execution as soon 
        // as a failure occurs, main reason is UI tests are slower than the 
        // unit tests and we don't want to wait to find out we have a problem.
        continueAfterFailure = false
        
        app = XCUIApplication()
        
        // * Here we pass launch arguments to `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` 
        // in our AppDelegate. This is the only place where we can communicate 
        // with the app in UI tests since it is black-boxed, so we need to do 
        // the setup here.
        app.launchArguments.append(contentsOf: ["CLEAN_STORAGE", "ALPHA_ENV", "STUB_REQUESTS"])
    }

    func testSignup() {
        // * We launch to app to start testing. This is the most time consuming step
        // so we will combine all 3 tests and do them in one launch.
        app.launch()
      
        // * Preparing the views that we will check later if they exist
        // let landingView = app.otherElements["LandingView"]
        // let signupView = app.otherElements["SignupCardView"]
        // let signupLoadingView = app.otherElements["SignupLoadingView"]

        // Test Closing with Close Button
        app.openSignupScreen()
        // * This was added as an extension to `XCUIApplication` because it is 
        // used a lot of times. We need to navigate to the view we want to test.

        XCTAssert(signupView.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))
        // * Here we use .waitForExistence method to see if it appeared.

        // * Then we find the close button and tap on it to see if view is dismissed.
        let closeButton = app.buttons["SignupCardCloseButton"]
        closeButton.tap() // * Here we use tap method of XCUIElement.

        XCTAssert(landingView.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))
        // * We use waitForExistence method to see if landingView is visible after
        // dismissing SignupCardView

        // Test Closing with Swipe
        app.openSignupScreen() // * Starting to test the other 

        signup.swipeDown()
        // * Here we use swipeDown method of XCUIElement, which sends a swipe-down 
        // gesture to our top view! One of the coolest things that UI testing tools 
        // allow us to do is using gestures.

        XCTAssert(landingView.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))

        // Test signing up
        app.openSignupScreen()

        XCTAssert(signup.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))

        // * Here we are trying to get textfield inside another view, we know that 
        // it is the first subview of the container view so we use .firstMatch
        let emailField = app.otherElements["SignupEmailFieldContainer"].otherElements.firstMatch
        let passwordField = app.otherElements["SignupPasswordFieldContainer"].otherElements.firstMatch

        // * And we use the method we added in XCUIElement extension to clear 
        // old text(if there was any) and enter the new text.
        emailField.clearAndEnterText(text: "new.account@mail.com")
        passwordField.clearAndEnterText(text: "password123")

        app.buttons["SignupButton"].tap()

        XCTAssert(signupLoadingView.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))

    }
}
